        <h1>Personal Website (recursive)</h1>
            <p>I spent a couple of days working on a personal website as a school assignment. I think I did pretty well with it! As I’m doing it through Github Pages, I built all of it through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you’d like to check it out, click here!</p>

        <h1>RealiTree</h1>
            <p>At the end of my first trimester at school, I asked my friend Cody if he’d like to build a simple, old-school style webgame to teach concepts of binary trees for our end-of-second-semester project, HackSprint. When the theme of Reality dropped, we built out the concept of completing a binary tree to break free of a “faulty reality.” We brought Jesse in as a third, and all three of us created this within the course of a week. The MVP came out to be a much simpler version of what we were hoping to build, so there may be more in the future!</p>

        <h1>LiveCodes</h1>
            <p>Live Codes are by far my favorite part of being a Student Tutor. I’ve done multiple presentations for students, but these are the two that show programming at work. </p>
            <h2>Linked Lists in C</h2>
                <p>For my Linked List livecode, I used the example of creating a robot army, which was pretty well received among the student base (they regularly referenced “temp bot” from my presentation, which of course was a huge ego boost.)</p>

            <h2>PrintF in C</h2>
                <p>For my PrintF livecode, I kept things a bit more direct. There’s a lot of moving parts with PrintF, so I didn’t want to embellish things too much. It covers things like tokenizing input and function pointers. Students were pretty engaged throughout the presentation, and asked multiple really interesting questions. All in all, I’m really proud of how this livecode went</p>

        <h1>Reservation Spreadsheet</h1>
            <p>When I got a job as a reservationist back in 2022 I didn’t realize it would re-spark my interest in spreadsheets and lead to learning some incredible functions to build complex things. This is a self-updating floor chart, designed to show reservations for specific tables on the right as the reservations are entered to the left. There’s also a series of graphs on the bottom right showing various metrics for the night, such as the amount of guests entering at various times and the total number of guests in the restaurant for the night. The spreadsheet’s format was built with printing in mind, so the kitchen, hosts, and managers had easy visualization to prepare for the night. To this day, this is one of my proudest projects.</p>
